Question-Answering over Documents Application with the integration of LLMs (Language Model), utilizing Node.js, the OpenAI API, Socket.IO and the powerful capabilities of LangChain framework. This groundbreaking project aims to revolutionize the way users interact with unstructured data, offering them an intuitive and efficient means of retrieving information and insights from a vast array of sources.

<b>By following this pipeline, we can build powerful question-answering over documents applications using LLMs.</b>

<b>Loading:</b> The initial step is to load the unstructured data from various sources. This data can be fetched from different locations, and the LangChain integration hub provides a range of loaders for this purpose. Each loader retrieves data and converts it into a LangChain Document format.

<b>Splitting:</b> Next, the loaded data is broken down into splits of a specified size using text splitters. This step is essential for handling large volumes of data efficiently and processing them in manageable chunks.
Storage: Once the data is split, it is stored in a designated storage system, which could be a vectorstore or other suitable storage solutions. Additionally, this storage might also include embeddings of the data to facilitate quick retrieval and matching with input questions.

<b>Retrieval:</b> In the retrieval phase, the application retrieves the relevant data splits from the storage. Often, this involves matching the embeddings of the input question with the stored data splits to find the most relevant information.
Generation: At this stage, an LLM (Language Model) is employed to produce the answer to the question. The LLM uses a prompt that includes both the question and the retrieved data splits to generate a precise and accurate answer.

<b>Conversation (Extension):</b> To enable multi-turn conversations, Memory is added to the QA chain. This allows the system to retain information from previous interactions, facilitating a seamless and context-aware conversation with the user.
